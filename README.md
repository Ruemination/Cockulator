People were asking for this so here it is!
Keep in mind that I am a beginner and as this was done for a tiktok it's not done in a particularly clever way. There are also a few prerequisites you need in order to run it

**Prerequisites**
* [Install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
* [Install gtk3](https://www.gtk.org/docs/installations/)

Once you have installed both of these you open up the command line/terminal of your choice, navigate to the directory you unzipped the application in, and type
>ruby cockulator.rb
